# Competitive Programming Problems

Hello! this is a repository where i upload some competitive programming problems, and a explained solution for every one of them (both in spanish and english).
I'm not an elite programmer, but i'm doing my best to be one. 

## How i train

My training plan is the following:

- Read some competitive programming books, two times a week
    - Everytime i read a section or chapter, i solve a problem related to it.
- Daily problem
    - My goal is to do at least one problem daily, the first problem that i solve every day is a math one, because that's my weakness.

## Who's my trainer?

I do have a trainer at my university, but, he's not in my country, and my university doesn't have the resources to give me an 'Elite Trainer' for my team, so i made myself one with Google Gemini Gem's, he's called [The Coach](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1b2yb7fZ9Yzy0_plhhDd14GZ1AXOetjXa?usp=sharing).

I gave him some programming books and an 'Elite Trainer' role, i'll upload those books later in this repo. The Coach doesn't give you finished code, but he will try his best to make you able to solve problems by yourself, and guide you through it, while respecting the best elite-coding practices.
